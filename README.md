# DO178_Case_Study
Case study for using MathWorks tools on a DO-178 project

To run this project, unzip the files to a folder that is on the MATLAB path.  After unzipping, there will be a *.prj file in the directory to open the Simulink Project for this.  Double click on that file and the project will open along with a MATLAB Live Script.  You can navigate the demo using the Live Script.
